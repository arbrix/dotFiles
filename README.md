### dotFiles

My collection of dot and config files. Highly optimised for OS X 10.9 and higher, Ubuntu Server 12.04 and higher. ZSH, tmux, VIM, Chef, Vagrant, Docker, CoreOS and many more.

### TODO

* Remove hard dependencies on external modules.
* Think about tmux-plugins
* Still not idea about tmux status bar
* Rewrite install/update procedure
* Definitily remove dependencies on tmux powerline. New "python" base powerline is not an option
