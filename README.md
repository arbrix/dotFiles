dotFiles
==================

My collection of dot and config files and useful scripts. Highly optimised for OS X 10.8 and higher, Ubuntu Server 12.0 and higher. BASH, ZSH, tmux, VIM, Chef, Vagrant.

TODO
==================

* Remove hard dependencies on external modules. Maybe to use git submodules?
* Clean up this mess.
