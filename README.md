dotFiles
==================

My collection of dot and config files. Highly optimised for OS X 10.9 and higher, Ubuntu Server 12.04 and higher. ZSH, tmux, VIM, Chef, Vagrant, Docker, CoreOS and many more.

TODO
==================

* Remove hard dependencies on external modules. Maybe to use git submodules?
* Clean up this mess.
